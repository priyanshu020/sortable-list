# Sortable List

This is a sortable list project which uses [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) for various events.
The idea is to just have a sortable list of 10 richest people that you can put into order.

On page reload it scrambles the list everytime and you can switch it to another spot. Also, you got Check Order button to verify the list whether it's in correct order or not.
